SportsTracker packaging (macOS, Linux, Windows)
===============================================

Info
----

* the tool 'jpackage' is used for creating native application packages for
  macOS, Windows and Linux
  * jpackage has been introduced with JDK 14
    (JEP 343, http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/343)
  * so at least JDK 14 is needed for packaging
  * jpackage is the replacement for the JavaFX packager which has been removed
    from the JDK, there is also no ANT plugin available anymore
* the created packages contain the required Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
* has been tested with AdoptOpenJDK 14 on:
  * macOS 10.15.4, Ubuntu Linux 18.04 and Windows 10
  * the packaged app and the installers are running perfectly without problems

* this directory contains the scripts for automatic SportsTracker packaging
* each os-specific package scripts creates an installer package
  (e.g. SportsTracker-7.x.x.dmg on macOS)
* only the following java modules (jmod) are needed:
  java.base,java.desktop,java.logging,java.net.http,java.scripting,java.sql,
  java.xml,jdk.crypto.ec,jdk.localedata,jdk.jsobject,jdk.unsupported
* the created app packages are much smaller, also caused by jmod usage
  * Example for macOS:
    * SportsTracker.app 7.5.1 built with JDK 10: 220 MB
    * SportsTracker.app 7.7.1 built with JDK 11: 140 MB


HowTo package
-------------

First on all platforms:

* build SportsTracker via 'mvn clean package'

Then on macOS:

* check the app settings and path variables in 'package-macos.sh'
* run 'package-macos.sh'
* the created SportsTracker-x.y.z.dmg package is located in directory 'package'

Then on Linux (Ubuntu):

* check the app settings and path variables in 'package-linux.sh'
* run 'package-linux.sh'
* the created DEB installer package is located in directory 'package'

Then on Windows:

* make sure the Microsoft DLL files were installed, see Windows Packaging Notes
* make sure InnoSetup is installed, has been tested with 5.5.9u
* check the app settings and path variables in 'package-windows.bat'
* run 'package-windows.bat'
* the created SportsTracker app package is located in directory 'package'
* open the InnoSetup project by opening the file 'SportsTracker.iss'
* update the properties in the project file (e.g. the version)
* run the installer creation (Run or F9)
* the created InnoSetup installer is located in directory 'package/InnoSetup'


macOS Packaging Notes
---------------------

* nothing special here


Linux Packaging Notes
---------------------

* Depending on the Linux system the created installer package is either an DEB
  (e.g. Ubuntu or Debian) or an RPM (e.g. Fedora) package.
* DEB package creation requires the package 'fakeroot', can be installed from
  the distribution repository.
* Package installation command: sudo dpkg -i sportstracker-x.y.z.deb
* Package uninstall command: sudo dpkg -P sportstracker


Windows Packaging Notes
-----------------------

* On Windows 10 (other versions unknown) the jpackager tool is missing the
  files MSVCP140.dll and VCRUNTIME140.dll. These need to be downloaded and
  installed from Microsoft before packaging:
  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=48145
* After installation these two files are located in C:\Windows\System32.
  They are also needed for SportsTracker app execution, that's why they are
  being copied into the created package.
  
* The InnoSetup installer creation is not executed by the jpackager, it seems
  to support the WiX installer tool only. Besides that, the creation can't be
  executed directly, because the missing Windows DLL files needs to be added 
  to the package before.
* Therefore the installer creation has to be done manually after packaging.
