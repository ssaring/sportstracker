v5.6.0:
 SportsTracker changes:
  - Findbugs bugfixes in all modules (minor code improvements)
  - Mac OS X application bundle creation: 
    - The huge JRE is not included anymore, the app size is now 12 MByte 
      instead of 67 before. Since JDK 7u6 for OS X the launcher is able to find
      the installed JRE (needs to be installed!)
    - The appbundler Ant library is now included, no installation needed.
  - Java WebStart for Mac OS X is working again, when JDK / JRE 7u6 or later
    is installed.
  - Overview Dialog: improved weight graph (SF feature request #3554633):
    Missing weight values will be interpolated instead of set to 0.
  - Calendar View: (SF feature request #3082257):
    current day is better recognizable by using a different color (blue for
    weekdays, red/orange for sundays)
  - Overview Dialog:
    - new diagram mode for sport subtype overview of a selected sport type
      (shows the distances per sport subtype of one sport type)
    - new diagram mode for equipment usage overview of a selected sport type
      (shows the distances per equipment of one sport type)
    - bigger size, much more readable (still fits on 1024x768 displays)
  - update to Groovy 2.0.1, usage of new Groovy features
    - use only the required Groovy modules instead of groovy-all dependency
      => the Groovy libraries are now about 3 MByte smaller
    - use of the new Groovy-Eclipse compiler plugin for Maven (2.7.0_01)
    - usage of the new @TypeChecked type checking at compilation time in all
      Groovy unit tests, type errors are now found immediately
    - usage of the new @TypeChecked type checking makes no sense for the
      Groovy exercise parsers, the dynamic XML parsing features can't be used
      anymore
  - update of JDOM library to version 2.0.2
 ExerciseViewer changes:
  - Garmin TCX Parser: Fix for SourceForge-Bug #3551583 
    (Fail to parse tcx files with laps without altitude)
  - Track Panel: added tooltips to all track points, so the track can now be
    followed easily on the map. The tooltips show:
    - track point number, time, distance
    - altitude, heartrate, speed, temperature (if available)
 Translations:
  - updated german translation by Stefan Saring
  - updated french translation by Nicolas Ollivier <nicollivier@gmail.com>

v5.5.0:
 ExerciseViewer changes:
  - Bugfix in the Timex PWX exercise parser (occurs e.g. on Timex Ironman GPS 
    T5K444 after installing a firmware update)
 SportsTracker changes:
  - update of JDOM library from version 1.1.3 to 2.0.1, (API changes)
    - supports generics now, unchecked-warnings doesn't need to be suppressed 
      anymore
  - Maven project in Eclipse IDE: ignoring the maven-dependency-plugin in the
    Eclipse lifecycle => no more error messages
  - exclusion of Java WebStart (javaws.jar) dependency in BSAF, so Maven build
    now works for JDK 7 on Mac OS X
  - all Dialogs are now always placed centered relative to their parent 
    windows (doesn't make sense to restore the previous position when the 
    parent has been moved)
  - Bugfix for Mac OS X: all Dialogs were always placed in upper left corner
    now centered relative to their parents
  - Toolbars in Mac OS X: 
    - all buttons are now displayed in OS X toolbar style
    - rollover effects in Calendar view are disabled
  - Ant script for Mac OS X App bundle creation (located in misc/appbundler)
  - New HiRes SportsTracker application icon, old LowRes icon looked ugly in
    larger toolbars or application switchers (mostly on Mac OS X, Windows 7)
  - SportsTracker icon is available in many sizes, it's needed for different
    window and dock sizes depending on the operating system and user settings
    (automatic scaling looks ugly)
  - Execise file existence check after application startup. A warning dialog 
    displays all exercises where the attached files can't be found.
  - Toolbars: no focus painted for buttons anymore, was strange behavior  
  - updated signature keys for Java Webstart installation (old keys will 
    expire in 2013)

v5.4.0:

  - Exercise, Note and Weight dialog: dialogs can be closed with Escape key
    when the focus is on the date picker component (initial focus)
  - SF Feature Request 2927194: copy entries (exercises, notes, weights)
    - user can simply copy entries from the context or main menu, he only
      needs to enter the new date
  - All Exercise, Note and Weight actions (add, edit, copy):
    => select the edited entry in the current view when action is completed
       (bigger refactoring for automatic view updates after data changes)
  - Use of @Override annotation instead of {@inheritDoc} in all classes, 
    so implementation errors can be detected by the compiler
  - Refactoring in all Exericse/Notw/WeightListView: move the similar methods
    to BaseListView base class
  - Exercise / Note / Weight List View: context menu on right mouse click for 
    adding, editing, copying and deleting the selected table entry
  - Maven build: update to groovy-eclipse-compiler 2.5.2 which
    - adds support for Eclipse 3.7.1

  - added ANT build file 'build-no-netbeans.xml' for building and testing
    SportsTracker on systems with no NetBeans installation or for users of
    other IDE's
  - Eclipse project:
    - removed all duplicate resource warnings for .svn-subdirectories

 PolarViewer changes:
  - Diagram Panel: diagram chart will now be correctly redrawn when screen
    size changes (it was just scaled before)

v3.5.0:
 SportsTracker changes:
  - new interface STContext and implementation class for distribution of
    all GUI-related dependencies to all application components (it also 
    contains the SwingApplicationFramework context and convinience methods)
  - use of Guice 1.0 for dependency injection - the benefits are:
    - no more static singleton access (STMain.getInstance(),
      STMain.getDocument(), STMain.getView(), ...)
    - all components only get access to the inserted components, this
      this prevents invalid/unwanted component dependecies
    - refactoring: move of document- and view-functionality from the 
      sub-components and the dialogs to STController class
      => much less dependencies, all components are better testable
    - move of FormatUtils from STView to STContext, now they can be
      accessed from everywhere without the STView dependency
    - CalendarCellExerciseListDialog: removed STDocument dependencies
    - use of Guice Provides's to create dialogs with dependency injection
      (in AboutDialog, ExerciseDialog, OptionsDialog, FilterDialog,
      StatisticDialog, OverviewDialog, SportTypeListDialog, SportTypeDialog,
      HRMFileOpenDialog, StatisticResultsDialog, CalendarCellExerciseListDialog)
    - disadvanteges of Guice usage (not dramatic): SportsTracker needs almost 
      1 sec longer at initial start and uses 2,5 MByte more memory 
      (Spring would not be better)
      => application performance has not changed after startup
  - STDocument, STView and STController are now encapsulated by interfaces, so 
    they can be simply replaced for unit testing (e.g. by mock objects)
  - Refactoring ResourceHelper: 
    - renamed to ResourceReader
    - not static anymore, can be accessed by all components from STContext
  - Refactoring STMessageDialog:
    - removed this class, message and confirmation dialogs can now be 
      created in STContext
      => no more static access, so the STContext / the dialogs can be 
         replaced by mocks in unit tests
  - Refactoring HRMFileOpenDialog: no static access anymore
  - Refactoring: New interface ExerciseView for all view implementations,
    so the views can be mocked in unit tests. It also contains the ExerciseView
    enumeration from STView, it's now called ViewType.
  - added EasyMock 2.4 library for unit testing
  - example unit tests for STController:deleteExercise()
    => now very easy possible via dependency injection and mocking
    => basis for tests when adding new features/bugfixes
  - Options Dialog: configuration of the default automatic calculation type
    in the Exercise Dialog (distance, avg speed or duration)
  - Printing support:
    - List view: print table of displayed exercises (confirmation dialog
      when there are too many exercises displayed)
    - Calendar view: prints the calendar of the selected month and year
    - unit tests for printing in STController
  - Nimbus Look&Feel improvements for the date picker widget (JXDatePicker 
    from SwingX project)
    - draw the Nimbus focus border when the textfield gets the focus
    - display a better dropdown-icon (still not the original Nimbus one
      but does not look so terrible anymore)
    - use antialiased text in the month view component
  - bugfix of text antialiasing in the JXDatePicker (from SwingX project)
    - bugfix in custom BasicMonthViewUI, will hopefully be included in 
      SwingX 0.9.4 => DatePickerUtils workarounds were removed
   - updated czech translation by Petr Marcik <marcikp@seznam.cz>
   - Sourceforge Feature request #2106264: Optional command line parameter
     '--datadir' for setting a custom application data directory. 
     Example for storing data in the installation directory: 
     'java -jar SportsTracker.jar --datadir=.'
  - SwingX updated to version 0.9.4 (the JAR is 250 kByte smaller). My
    DatePickerAddon bugfix (bug #913) was included => workaround removed.

- PolarViewer changes:
  - use of Guice for dependency injection (same as for SportsTracker)
    - new context interface PVContext (just a subset of STContext)
    - no more (static) central access via PVMain in all components
    - all components only get the dependecies they are need
    - the PVOptions are now stored in PVDocument
    => less code after all changes 
  - contributions by Roland Hostettler <r.hostettler@gmx.ch> for the 
    Polar F6 exercise parser: 
    - support for percental heartrate ranges
    - support for Polar F11 exercise files, including unit tests
      (file download requires version 0.0.3 of the f6-split-tool)

v3.4.2:
 SportsTracker changes:
  - rollover effect buttons in the Calendar View toolbar, works on all 
    look & feels (adopted from the jEdit project - www.jedit.org)
  - updated french translation by Nicolas Ollivier <nicollivier@gmail.com>
  - SwingX updated to version 0.9.3 (bugfixes)
  - JFreeChart updated to version 1.0.10 (bugfixes)

    (display files in PolarViewer and import exercise data) 

v3.4.1:
 SportsTracker changes:
  - bugfix: exceptions in Sport type list dialog when no sport types defined

v3.4.0:
 SportsTracker changes:
 - redesigned Exercise dialog for usability improvements, it is now better 
   understandable for new users - the changes are:
   - vertical arrangement of sport type, sport subtype and intensity comboboxes
     => label and combobox are on one line and the combobox texts can be longer
   - vertical arrangement of distance, avg speed and duration textfields
     => no more "Calculate ..." buttons (was very confusing), there's an
        "Automatic Calculation" checkbox for each textfield instead
     => so the user can choose which value will be calculated automatically on
        change of the other values (distance, avg speed or duration)
   - vertical arrangement of optional ascent, heartrate and calories textfields
     => label and textfield are on one line, better readability
   - HRM: the Import and View buttons are now below the HRM filename textfield
     => HRM filename textfield displays longer filenames better and the Import
        and View buttons got better (longer) names
   - the hour and minute inputs now select their text when they get the focus
     (so the time can be entered much faster)
  - redesigned Options dialog for usability improvements:
    - splitted into 3 panels: Main, Units and PolarViewer
      => number of options increases all the time, only one panel gets too big
      => more simple for the user to find an option when they are grouped
    - vertical arrangement of the radiobox widgets (more consistent)
    - use Monday and Sunday radiobox widgets for week start
    - better text resources for unit settings (with example units)
  - Look&Feel selection in the Options dialog: the user can choose one of all
    the available look and feels, it will be changed at runtime without restart
    (so e.g. the great new Nimbus Look&Feel can be used with Java 6 UpdateN)
  - Calendar view: use of Home icon instead of Today button (more consistent)
  - Sport Type dialog: use of better understandable text resources (some with
    examples) and tooltips for descriptions
  - use of tag {@inheritDoc} do avoid documentation duplicates
  - project files updated for NetBeans 6.1
    - the project now uses the new NetBeans Library feature, no problems with
      with absolute library file locations anymore
  - Groovy updated to version 1.5.6
  - SwingX updated to version 0.9.2
  - JUnit updated to version 4.4, bugfixes in unit tests
  - check the complete project with FindBugs => fixed a lot of problems
  - bugfix: proper error handling when creating application directory
  - all ST and PV data classes are now final
  - added Eclipse project files (Eclipse 3.3 + Groovy plugin)
  - increased list cell height and table row height in all views and dialogs
    (was too compressed)
  - layout bugfixes in SportsTracker and PolarViewer when using the Nimbus L&F
  - contributions by Kai Pastor <dg0yt@users.sourceforge.net>:
    - Overview Dialog improvements: 
      - dialog shows the last 12 months by default
      - added stacked view for all sport types (transparent graphs)
      - tooltips show sport type
      - fixed ticks

v3.3.0:
 SportsTracker changes:
  - new Polish translation contributed by Zbigniew Ogledzki <zgibek@gazeta.pl>
  - updated to SwingX version 2008_02_03, the GTK-L&F bug for the data picker
    has been fixed (https://swingx.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=667)
  - bugfix: workaround for using antialiasing in the date picker widgets 
    (month view) when using GTK-L&F
  - bugfix in Exercise dialog: correct tab focus order in Exercise Data panel
  - updated to Groovy 1.5.4 (bugfix release)
  - new baseclass IDObject for all SportsTracker data classes (they all need 
    unique IDs)
  - new generic class IDObjectList which contains unique instances of IDObject
    subclasses and provides usefull management methods (until now each data 
    object with lists had this functionality)
  - unit tests for IDObject and IDObjectList
  - the classes Exercise, SportType, SportSubtype and Equipment are now 
    subclasses of IDObject => less code needed
  - the classes ExerciseList and SportTypeList now extend IDObjectList, so all
    the list management functionality was removed, also in the test classes
    => no more "deep nested" method calls to get sport types or exercises
  - the SportSubType list and the Equipment list in the SportType class are now
    using IDObjectList, so all the list management functionality was removed, 
    the SportTypeListTest class is not needed anymore
  - STView now stores the list of exercises to be displayed (can also be the 
    filtered list), the benefits are:
    - the list is not stored in every view anymore, no more duplicate problems
      or deleted exercise references
    - less memory consumption (e.g. 1,3 MByte less for 1.400 exercises)
    - better performance, the list is only filtered once on data changes
  - ask the user for defining sport types when there are no available (better
    usability at intial startup)
 PolarViewer changes:
  - contribution by Roland Hostettler <r.hostettler@gmx.ch>:
    support for displaying Polar F6 exercise files in PolarViewer and import
    the data from exercise files when adding new exercises
  - bugfix for SourceForge bug#1897208: no more JFreeChart exceptions in the
    Diagram panel when the exercise contains laps with same time second value
  - SourceForge feature request #1900878: percentual heartrate range support:
    - added abolute and percentual range support in class HeartRateLimit
    - Main panel: display percentual range values (e.g. 60 - 80 %)
    - Diagram panel: the current heartrate range is not displayed for 
      percentual ranges (not possible, maximum heartrate is unknown)
    - unit test for parsing SRD exercises with percentual heartrate ranges

v3.2.0:
 SportsTracker changes:
  - Overview Diagram:
    - new time mode: display statistic values for all the weeks of the selected 
      year (modes before: 'months of year' or 'last 10 years until')
    - use of the new JFreeChart API (deprecated renderer methods)
  - Exercise Dialog: use of JXDatePicker (from SwingX project) for easy date
    selection and spinner widgets for easy time selection
  - Filter Dialog: use of JXDatePicker (from SwingX project) for easy date
    selection
  - Filter Dialog bugfix: use of the end of the day for the filter end date,
    otherise the exercises of the last day will not be included
  - Calendar View bugfix: show correct week number (of current year) when week 
    starts on sunday
  - Exercise Dialog: redesigned user interface, splitted into separate tabs 
    for main data, optional data and comment. The advantages are:
    - so there's enough space for future additions
    - many users only use the main data, so they are not bothered by all the
       other widgets
  - Options Dialog: removed the "always display optional exercise data" option,
    it is not needed anymore
  - updated french translation by Nicolas Ollivier <nicolas.ollivier@neuf.fr>
  - updated to Groovy 1.5.1 (no exception workarounds in test classes needed
    anymore)
  - Equipment tracking support:
    - added equipment support to the data (SportType, Exercises), filter 
      and XML storage classes (and unit tests for all of them)
    - SportTypeDialog: the user can assign equipment to sport types (e.g. bikes
       for cycling or shoes for running)
    - ExerciseDialog: the user can assign the used equipment in exercises
    - Filter-/StatisticDialog: the user can filter exercises for specific 
      equipment => so the user can e.g. check the total running distance for
      specific shoes
  - Exercise Dialog: button for copy the comment from previous similar 
    exercises (with same sport type and subtype) => saves a lot of typing
  - Calendar View: improved look by using color gradients in calendar view
    (weekname line, background, summary, selection)
  - Calendar View: buttons for year, month selection does not have borders
    anymore on Windows XP and Metal (Swing default) Look&Feel
  - Exercice and Overview Dialog: use same height for spinner widgets as 
    controls in same line (date picker or comboboxes)
  - added local JUnit 4.1 Jar, so there's no NetBeans library dependency for
    command line build anymore (or when NetBeans is not installed)
  - update to JFreeChart 1.0.9 (bugfixes)
  - history of resource (I18N) changes in I18N.txt (helpfull for translation
    updates)

    selected directory (also after SportsTracker was restarted)
 PolarViewer changes:
  - Refactoring:
    - new ExerciseParser interface (was an abstract class before)
    - new AbstractExerciseParser class with common functionality for all parser
      implementations
  - Exercise parser plugin system: ExerciseParserFactory now uses the
    ServiceLoader for lookup the appropriate exercise parser implementation
    - no direct coupling between the factory and the parser implementations
      anymore
    - new parser implementations can be added just by adding the parser-Jar to
      the application classpath (no changes in SportsTracker required)
