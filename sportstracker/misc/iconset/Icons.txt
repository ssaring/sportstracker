SportsTracker Icon
------------------

The SportsTracker application icon is based on icons from the open source
projects GTK+ (http://www.gtk.org) and Tango (http://tango.freedesktop.org).


Toolbar and Menu Icons
----------------------

All the toolbar and menu icons are taken from the Free Version of the IcoMoon
project (https://icomoon.io, GPL licensed). Some icons are new creations
based on the IcoMoon icons.

Every icon is monochrome and is using dark gray as the main color, so the user
is not distracted and can focus on the application content. Unfortunately the
icons of the IcoMoon project are black, so they must be converted manually to
dark gray.
This can be done by using tools like Gimp or Paint.net, the opacity of the
icons needs to be set to 70% (can be edited in the layer properties).

The size of all toolbar and menu icons is 16x16 px. The IcoMoon project also
provides 32x32 px icons, so it's possible to support high resolution (aka
"retina") displays in future.

The IcoMoon collections does not provide all icons, e.g. for viewing HRM files
or adding new Exercise entries. These icons have been created by combining and
editing existing IcoMoon icons.
The tool Inkscape has been used for editing the SVG versions of the IcoMoon
icons (vector based and resolution independent). All the SVG icons are stored
in the directory 'svg' for further editing or conversion. Custom SportsTracker
icons are using the filename prefix 'st'.
The conversion to PNG files has also been done with Inkscape  The command
'Export PNG Image' opens a dialog where the Export Area must be the Page and
the Image Size needs to be set to 16x16.
The opacity of the custom icons must also be set to 70% afterwards (see above).
